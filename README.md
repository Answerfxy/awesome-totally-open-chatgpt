ChatGPT is GPT-3.5 with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for chat system.

By alternative, I mean projects feature different language model for chat system. 
Projects are **not** counted if they are:
- alternative frontend projects because they just call the API from OpenAI. 
- alternative transformer decoder models to GPT 3.5 either because the training data of them are (mostly) not for chat system.
